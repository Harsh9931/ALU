# DESCRIPTION 
  An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental component of a CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations. This 4-bit ALU is implemented in Verilog and supports five basic operations:

Addition (ADD)

Subtraction (SUB)
Bitwise AND
Bitwise OR
Bitwise NOT

The 4-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a combinational circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations based on a control signal (ALU_Sel). It takes two 4-bit inputs (A and B) and a 3-bit control signal, which determines the operation to be executed. The output (ALU_Out) is a 4-bit result corresponding to the selected operation. The ALU supports five fundamental operations: addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and bitwise NOT.

Conclusion :

The 4-bit ALU efficiently performs basic arithmetic and logical operations using a combinational circuit. It correctly executes addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT operations based on the control signal. The testbench verifies its functionality, ensuring accurate results for different inputs. This ALU serves as a fundamental building block for more complex processors, demonstrating essential computational capabilities in digital circuits.
